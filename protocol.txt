The protocol used for online play in this game is a very simple, primitive, and non-bloated one. It is not JSON, but it is pure text, with simple delimiters. 

On connection, the host and peer will exchange usernames. Next, they will exchange the dimensions of their board (in format of "DIM_X/DIM_Y"). The host will send the first message, whereas the peer will be waiting for the host. 

Now, throughout the game, they will exchange coordinates in the format described above, which would encode their moves, respectively. If we want to "visualize" this:

->USERNAME
->DIM_X/DIM_Y

->COORD_X/COORD_Y

Additionally, if a user wants to send a message to his opponent, the protocol for doing that is "@[message]".
